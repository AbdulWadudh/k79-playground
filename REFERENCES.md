# TURBOREPO

Welcome to Turborepo! Let's get you set up with a new codebase.

Created a new Turborepo with the following:

apps

- apps/docs
- apps/web

packages

- packages/eslint-config-custom
- packages/tsconfig
- packages/ui

## Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

Build all apps and packages

```
bun run build
```

Develop all apps and packages

```
bun run dev
```

Lint all apps and packages

```
bun run lint
```

Turborepo will cache locally by default. For an additional speed boost, enable Remote Caching with Vercel by entering the following command:

```
bunx turbo login
```

## Remote Caching

Remote Caching shares your cached Turborepo task outputs and logs across

all your teamâ€™s Vercel projects. It also can share outputs
with other services that enable Remote Caching, like CI/CD systems.
This results in faster build times and deployments for your team.
For more info, see https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching

Success! Turborepo CLI authorized for Mohammed Abdul Wadudh Samdani

#### To disable Remote Caching, run:

```
npx turbo unlink
```
